# What the hell is even this?
well, basically it's been a long time since I used git professionally to keep track of coding projects and I've been learning other stuff for past couple of years.
but, now I'm going back to refresh my knowledge on Git and Github because I need it more than ever, since I decided to learn programming in a more serious fasion.
nothing much here :)
