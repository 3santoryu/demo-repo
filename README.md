# What the hell is even this?
well, basically it's been a long time since I used git professionally to keep track of coding projects and I've been learning other stuff for past couple of years.
but, now I'm going back to refresh my knowledge on Git and Github because I need it more than ever, since I decided to learn programming in a more serious way.
(note: changed 
nothing much here :)

just adding this to see how changes apply in Github :)

so, I pulled this repo from Github, opened it in VS Code on my local machine, changed this README.md file and added this line.
